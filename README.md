# INventory
W.I.P.:  INventory is inventory management software with the ability to coordinate projects, check items in and out, and sync projects and data to a local server. INventory supports integration with other apps with the ability to execute functions (like adding, editing, and removing projects and items) directly through the command line by starting INventory in headless mode.
